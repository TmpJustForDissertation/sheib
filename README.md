# 1.Introduction
This web page provides source code and simulated datasets mentioned in the article "SHEIB: a novel stochastic-based approach for detecting high-order epistatic interactions using bioinformation in genome-wide association studies". The article has been submitted to BMC Bioinformatics but has not been published. Please don't download these files, if you are not reviewers or editors.<br>
The real dataset (WTCCC dataset) in the article will not be uploaded. Because the dataset was downloaded from https://www.wtccc.org.uk/. We have no right to upload it.
# 2.The uploaded files
## sheib.zip:
All files like ***.cpp** and ***.h** are source code of SHEIB. It is implemented by C++.<br>
**bd_gwas.tped** and **bd_gwas.tfam** are sample examples of real gwas dataset. There are only 4000 SNPs in the example.<br>
**data.txt** is a sample example of simulated data. It contains 1000 SNPs and [P1,P2] is the epistatic interaction.<br>
**snps_after_2.txt** is the gene-mapping data from NCBI.<br>
**gene_pairs_after_4.txt** is the gene association data from DIP.<br>
**hrpd_after_3.txt** is the gene association data from HRPD.<br>
**mint_after_4.txt** is the gene association data from MINT.<br>
**reactome_after_4.txt** is the gene association data from Reactome.<br>
**sheib** is an executable file compiled by gcc on Linux 64.<br>
**sheib.exe** is an executable file compiled by cygwin64 on win7 64.<br>
**sheib.cbp**, **sheib.depend** and **sheib.layout** are files generated by CodeBlocks automatically. Users can use CodeBlocks to open them.<br>
## simulated_datasets
### DME_and_DNME_100
The folder contains 68 2-order epistatic models. For each model, a compressed file is uploaded. In each compressed file, there are 100 simulated data (files). The filename indicates the epistatic interaction in the file.
### DME_and_DNME_1000
This simulated dataset is too large to be uploaded (about 2.63GB). If you need it, you can send email to 2276632042@qq.com (the first author of the article).<br>
### DNME3_100
The folder contains 40 3-order epistatic models. For each model, a compressed file is uploaded. In each compressed file, there are 100 simulated data (files). The filename indicates the epistatic interaction in the file.

# 4.parameters

parameter|default|description
----|----|----
type|0|Type of the input file. 0 (simulated data), 1 (real gwas data).
cG|0.05|Threshold of pvalue of G-test.
cGc|0.05|Threshold of gc.
o|-1|Maximum order while generating random SNP combinations. -1 means that SHEIB should calculate it based on the number of samples in the gwas data.
maxGen|-1|Maximum iterations. -1 means that SHEIB will never stop by itself.
pb|0.8|The probability of considering bioinformation while generating random SNP combinations.
nShow|4|It is used to control echo. SHEIB will print epistatic interactions every nShown iteractions. nShown<0 means that SHEIB will not print interactions.
seed|0|Random seed.
rn|-1|How many epistatic interactions should be collected. -1 means that SHEIB will write all interactions into the result.
cs|0|1 means that SHEIB will start a control thread. When users type "Enter", the program will be paused and enter an interactive interface. Users can type some commands. type "help" to get a command list and further information. 0 means SHEIB will not start the control thread.
in|data.txt|The input gwas file.
out|result.txt|The output file.
SNP2Genes|null|Gene-mapping data.
AssociatedGenes|null|Gene association data.
