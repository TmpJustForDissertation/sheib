# introduction
This web page provides source code and simulated datasets mentioned in the article "SHEIB: a novel stochastic-based approach for detecting high-order epistatic interactions using bioinformation in genome-wide association studies". The article has been submitted to BMC Bioinformatics but has not been published.
The real dataset (WTCCC dataset) in the article will not be uploaded. Because the dataset was downloaded from https://www.wtccc.org.uk/. We have no right to upload it.
# source code
